### Contributors to the Inkwell Project

The research that lead to the development of Inkwell is co-authored by Jérôme Nowak, Anesta Kothari (co-first author), Hongquan Li, Jaspreet Pannu, Dani Algazi, and Manu Prakash.

M.P., H.L. and A.K. identified the research problem. M.P., A.K. and D.A. developed the early prototypes and experiments. J.N. led the design of Inkwell and conducted the analysis of the physical principles involved. J.N. and A.K. developed prototypes and implemented the final Inkwell device with input from all authors. J.N., H.L. and A.K. set up the motorized smearing device for characterizations. H.L. set up the apparatus for high-speed imaging and the Octopi microscope for scanning the blood smears. J.N. and A.K. performed data collection. A.K. designed the usability studies. J.P. validated an earlier prototype in field settings. J.N., H.L., A.K., and M.P. wrote the manuscript with feedback from all authors.

### Authors of the files in this repository

The CAD design and prototypes for Inkwell versions 0.1 to 1.2 and 2.4 to 2.9.5 were made by Jérôme Nowak. Photos were taken by Jérôme Nowak.
The CAD design and prototypes for Inkwell versions 2.0 to 2.3.2 were made by Anesta Kothari.
(Note: Earlier iterations in the exploratory phase prior to v0.1 did not have a clear naming scheme and are not documented in this repository.)
